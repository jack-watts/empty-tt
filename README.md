[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/jack-watts/empty-dci-tt)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/jack-watts/empty-dci-tt) [![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/jack-watts/empty-tt)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jack-watts/empty-tt) ![Build](https://github.com/jack-watts/empty-dci-tt/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

A simple tool that enables a user to create a minimal [ST 428-7 Subtitle](https://doi.org/10.5594/SMPTE.ST428-7.2014) XML Document in accordance with ISDCF Technicial Doc 16 - SMPTE ST 428-7 D-Cinema Timed Text Track File - Minimal Empty Document Requirements as per said requirements stipulated in RDD 52 - SMPTE DCP Bv2.1 Application Profile available at [10.5594/SMPTE.RDD52.2020](https://doi.org/10.5594/SMPTE.RDD52.2020).

## Installation & Build

Empty TT is a multi-platform tool and has been built under Windows/x86_64, Darwin/x86_64 (macOS 10.12 or higher) and linux/x86_64. It relies on ASDCPlib if you want to wrap the generated XML and anciliary resources into D-Cinema MXF track files. ASDCPlib can be found [here](https://github.com/cinecert/asdcplib).

The tt library can be used in two ways;

- With the command line wrapper ''empty-tt'

- Or with the API directly. See /tt/lib.go or the [Go reference](https://jack-watts.github.io/empty-dci-tt) for details.

Pre-compiled binaries are provided for convenience and can be found under [Releases](https://github.com/jack-watts/empty-dci-tt/releases).

To build from source using Go

```go
go get -u
sh build.sh
```

## Usage

```shell
  -T            - write MXF trackfile, requires '-d'  

  -d <int>      - set the duration of the track file. (default 24)  

  -e            - encrypt trackfile  

  -image        - Inidcate that image profile is to be used.  

  -l <string>   - set the RFC 5646 Language subtag (default "en")  

  -m <int>      - set the DisplayType.'0'=MainSubtitle,'1'=ClosedCaption. (default "0")  

  -o <string>   - set the output path, Default is StdOut  

  -p <string>   - set the frame rate of the track file. (default "24")  

  -r <int>      - set the ReelNumber (default 1)  

  -t <string>   - set the ContentTitleText value. (default "No Title")  

  -text         - Inidcate that text profile is to be used. (default true)  

  -x <string>   - path to 428-7 XML to use as template  
```



### Examples

The follwoing examples showcase the different command expressions that can be used.

**1. Create a MainSubtitle Text profile document**

```bash
$ empty-tt -text -p 24 -m 0 -r 1 -t "MyTitle"
```

**2. Create an MainSubtitle Image profile document**

```bash
$ empty-tt -image -p 24 -m 0 -r 1 -t "MyTitle"
```

**3. Create a MainSubtitle Text profile document and MXF track file**

```bash
$ empty-tt -text -T -p 24 -m 0 -r 1 -t "MyTitle" -d 48 -o <path-to-dir>
```

**4. Create a ClosedCaption Text profile document from XML template and encrypted MXF track file**

```bash
$ empty-tt -text -T -e -p 24 -m -r 1 -t "MyTitle" -d 48 -x <path-to-xml-file> -o <path-to-dir>
```

### Notes

1. Writes to StdOut if no output path is specified.

2. When writing to StdOut, no anciliary resources are generated.

3. Using the MXF option "-T" also requires "-o".

4. Generates a unique PNG image every execution.

5. Any integer value greater than 1 for option "-m" results in a ClosedCaption DisplayType.

6. An template document with a DCST 2007 namespace will be rejected.

7. Documents are written with a DCST 2014 namespace by default.

8. The shipped bundled default Font is Arial Unicode with no glyph structures present. It has a file name of constant = "232c45d8-fde8-4e5e-86b9-86e96354daf3".

9. Available flags can be invoked out of order.

10. The TimeIn value will adjust automatically depending if the Reel number is >= 1.

11. file prefix and suffix are handled automatically and are structed as follows:
    
    1. XML: uuid_reelNo.xml
    
    2. MXF: uuid_reelNo_sub.mxf | uuid_reelNo_cap.mxf
